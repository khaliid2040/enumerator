# enumerator
The program called enumerator is a c program i developed from scratch i intended it to make my daily work easir. I chose c programming because first it is faster and second 
it's dependency management is easier i amde the program to become dependent from external libraries as much as possible. This is the beginning of the project and i will 
maintain it. if it becomes like fixing bugs
